Mohammad wants to challenge Ramin's math ability. It provides a start and end value that contains an interval of integers (including the start and end points). Ramin must find the number of perfect square numbers in that interval.
Note: A perfect square number is an integer that is equal to the square of an integer.

Example:

l = 24
r = 49

Here there are 3 perfect square numbers in the interval [24, 49][24,49] (25, 36 and 49). So the answer is 3.
Since Ramin doesn't have the patience to calculate, he asks you to help him and answer qq of its questions.

## Input
The input consists of two lines. In the first line there is qq, which indicates the number of questions that Ramin asks you, and in each qq of the next line, there are two numbers that indicate ll and rr, respectively.
1≤q≤100
rl≤r
l, r 1≤l,r≤10

 

## Output
The output of your program should contain qq lines, in the iith line you should print the answer to the iith question.
