## Problem

One of the professors of the mathematics faculty, who is very interested in the Genealogy Mathematics project, after studying the background of his professors and their professors, etc., which are in the large database of this project, finally reached the great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss as his mathematical ancestor. In addition to great works in mathematics, stories about calculating the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 using formulas are also attributed to his school days. In this way, this mathematics faculty professor became interested in the numbers made from the sum of numbers 1 to nn (such as 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.).

He named these numbers good numbers and wants you to find their different divisors; But since he is very busy, he doesn't have time to write the desired program and he has asked you to write a program that takes a number kk as input from the user and outputs the first good number that has at least kk natural divisor.


## Input
The input contains a natural number kk, the number of divisors of the desired good number.
3001≤k≤300

## Output
The output of your program is a natural number. This natural number must be the first good natural number that has at least kk natural divisor.
