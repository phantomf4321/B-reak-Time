The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence that is defined as follows.

fib(1) = 1fib(1)=1

fib(2) = 2fib(2)=2

fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) fib(n)=fib(n−1)+fib(n−2)

Now, write a program that by taking a natural number nn as input, a string like s1, s2, ..., sn Print the + and - signs so that s_isbe positive if and only if the number ii is part of the Fibonacci sequence. Pay attention to the examples for better understanding.
